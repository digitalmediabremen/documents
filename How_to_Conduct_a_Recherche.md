# How to Conduct a Recherche?

the french word *recherche* denotes the process of browsing through loads of information with a more or less specific question or interest in mind. in english this process is often referred to as *research*. however, this usage can easily be confused with *scientific* research which might result in an unproductive fuzziness. therefore we denote the process of searching, investigation, inquiry, browsing, float, meandering, search and occasionally finding as *recherche*.

note that a *recherche* can and should be conducted with different levels of precision or fuzziness. in the very beginning of a project it is very helpful to just float around, vaguely glance at things, flip through magazing, or serendipitously follow leads. at a later point in a project a *recherche* might be much more goal oriented, for example when trying to find out about related or similar projects or ideas. in other words sometimes a *recherche* should have a clear goal and sometimes it should not.

## What to Include in a Recherche?

the most obvious thing to *recherche* is other artistic and design works. however, a *recherche* should not be limited to just that.

- artistic and design works
- mass products
- scientific research
- technologies ( techniques, skills, methods, and processes )
- tools
- algorithms
- ( physical ) materials
- keywords
- theories + theory objects

## Where to Conduct a Recherche?

although a traditional *recherche* usually starts in either a library or on google, it is well worth noting that this cannot be the sole resources. in a sense conducting a *recherche* is a process which is also inspired and driven by a certain kind of creativitiy and is a skill to be developed.

- plain internet searches ( i.e via search engines and keywords )
- user-generated information hubs ( e.g blogs, instagram, crowd funding platforms etcetera )
- public information hubs ( e.g wikipedia, patent databases, etcetera )
- physical libraries + archives ( e.g books, magazins, catalogs etcetera )
- conversations with different kinds of people ( e.g interviews )

a good starting point is for example the [Compendium Digitale](http://dm-hb.de/compendium), a collection of probably useful things.

## How to Organize, Archive and Present Findings

- in dedicated tools ( e.g evernote, pinterest, tumblr, etcetera )
- on a blog
- in a custom-made format ( e.g markdown-based notation system )
- in a moodboard or collage
- in a sketch- or scrapbook
- in a [Zettelkasten](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) ( see Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten )

in addition to such infrastructures ( be they physical or virtual ) certain methods have proven to help organizing the found material ( e.g tagging with keywords, categorizing, hyperlinking, etcetera ).

the bottom line here is that organizing, archiving and presenting, once again is highly individual and creative endeavor. as designer and/or artist it is vital to explore such concepts and develop one’s *own ways*.

some artist have even made a career of finding idiosyncratic forms for their research ( i.e [Mark Lombardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lombardi) )
