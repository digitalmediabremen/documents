# Thoughts on Sketching and Communication

@draft @todo(add scans of examples)

as designer/artist it is *very* helpful to add techniques to describe, discuss and develop ideas. one of the most common one apart from just using word or language is for sure the *sketch*.

however, often underestimated is the relevance of using sketching to complement conversation, discussions and idea finding processes. in the this context sketching is less of a final *product* but more a *process* tool.

### Develop a *Sketching Vocabulary*

sketch is not ( necessarily ) *artistic* drawing or proper illustration or any other such artistic/design activity. it can be thought of more as a set of visual idioms

regardless of what form a sketchbook takes, the bottom line is to always keep one you.

furthermore develop a dedicated style for your writing utilities.
