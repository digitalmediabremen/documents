# Handreichung / Notes on Thesis Documentations

This document aims to provide a few important points about thesis documentations in a TL;DR-style. a more comprehensive document on the topic is available at [Handreichung / Assistance for Bachelor + Master Theses / Documentation](http://dm-hb.de/dmafbamt).

- the *first part*, often refered to as the *written part* or *preliminary documentation*, must be submitted *before* the colloquium and at the deadline issued by Dez.1.
- the *second part* ( "Zweiter Teil der Dokumentation" ) usually submitted approx 3 weeks *after* the colloquium ( TBD with supervisors ).
- the *second part* can be an updated, extended or refinded version of the *first part*. it may contain documentation material of the colloquium. 
- physical formats ( e.g printed books ) are *very* welcome, however digital formats are also excepted ( ideally both ).
- digital formats may include e.g PDF, HTML, DOC, however material should also be submitted in an *open* format i.e images as PNG/JPG, text as markdown/TXT, and video as MOV/MPEG.
- website formats *must* be submitted as offline version.
- when sharing larger files ( e.g films ) use preferably HfKâ€™s OneDrive service. avoid other services like WeTransfer and Dropbox or at least make sure that links do NOT expire.
- the *second part* should also be compressed into a *Digital Media Website* version ( see https://digitalmedia-bremen.de/project-type/bachelor-theses + https://digitalmedia-bremen.de/project-type/master-theses )
- the *Digital Media Website* version may also be submitted to projects@digitalmedia-bremen.de by the student
