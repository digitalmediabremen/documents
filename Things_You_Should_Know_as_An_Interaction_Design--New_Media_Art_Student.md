# Things You Should Know as An Interaction Design / New Media Art Student

*Our field* is the term that we use in this document to describe *what we are doing* here in our program under the umbrella of *design* or *mediadesign*. This is not perfect but tries to reflect the fact that *what we are doing here* is very open and cloud-like ( i.e with fuzzy boundaries ) and constantly evolving.

The following collections are an attempt to frame the field that we are working in.
