# Notes on Master Project Exhibition

## egocentric versus community

the master 

- care about your own work and make sure to get all the help and advice you can
- … but also take care of the others. you are a group and a community
- excercise empathy and solidarity with everybody ( i.e help if somebody asks you, but also look around for people who need help )
- keep the professors and lecturers in the loop ( they are sometimes more resourceful than you think ;) and have a long history of helping to release tension ;) ;) )

## equipment + technology + materials + other resources

- take care to organize and acquire the tech/items/material you need
- there usually is a budget for buying materials ( usually not for paying work ) make sure to discuss beforehand how and on what it will be spend?
