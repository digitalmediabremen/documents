# Notes on Master Project Exhibition

- make it a rule that each student consults one of the supervisors 2–3 weeks before the opening to discuss the exhibition setup
- it is part of the master project that students organize, design and produce the exhibition.

## equipment + technology + materials + other resources

- students need to take care to organize and acquire the tech/items/material they need
- there usually is a budget for common cost ( e.g paint, screws, cables ) and tasks that a for the benefit of the entire group ( e.g design + print of poster ). this budget *cannot* be used to finance indivual project costs. students need to make sure *beforehand* how and on what budget will be spend? it is not possible to refund money with prior confirmation.

## egocentric versus community

- care about your own work and make sure to get all the help and advice you can
- … but also take care of the others. you are a group and a community
- excercise empathy and solidarity with everybody ( i.e help if somebody asks you, but also look around for people who need help )
- keep the professors and lecturers in the loop ( they are sometimes more resourceful than you think ;) and do have a long history of helping to release tension ;) ;) )
