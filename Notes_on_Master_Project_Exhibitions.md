# Notes on Master Project Exhibition

## student organzied exhibition

it is part of the master project that students organize, design and produce the exhibition. it is good practice to decide on one or two people who take care of the communication to externals. 

if the exhibition takes place 

## communication

- while on the one hand you can use any communication platform you choose, we strongly recommend not using external platforms like telegram or discord but rather our Digital Media infrastructure i.e Mattermost ( https://node.hfk-bremen.de ) or MS Teams. furthermore if you choose to communicate on alternative platforms make sure to include everyone in the group; students, lecturers and other people involved.
- each student is advised to consults at least one of the supervisors 2–3 weeks before the opening of the exhibition to discuss the exhibition setup.

## equipment + technology + materials + other resources

- students need to take care to organize and acquire the tech/items/material they need
- there usually is a budget for common cost ( e.g paint, screws, cables ) and tasks that a for the benefit of the entire group ( e.g design + print of poster ). this budget *cannot* be used to finance indivual project costs. students need to make sure *beforehand* how and on what budget will be spend? it is not possible to refund money with prior confirmation.

## egocentric versus community

- care about your own work and make sure to get all the help and advice you can
- … but also take care of the others. you are a group and a community
- excercise empathy and solidarity with everybody ( i.e help if somebody asks you, but also look around for people who need help )
- keep the professors and lecturers in the loop ( they are sometimes more resourceful than you think ;) and do have a long history of helping to release tension ;) ;) )
