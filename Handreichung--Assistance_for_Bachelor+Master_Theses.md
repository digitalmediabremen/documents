# Handreichung / Assistance for Bachelor + Master Theses

This document aims to function as an informal guideline for developing and completing a bachelor or master thesis. It is a set of suggestions rather than rules. Every student is encouraged to digress from these suggestions wherever suitable but should be equally prepared to justify such decisions later. First and foremost, a thesis is supposed to document a student’s ability to independently develop and work on a complex and relevant project.

The statements in this document do not override the existing *Prüfungsordnungen*.

## Modus Operandi

A thesis usually consists of a series of sometimes intermingled steps:

- Finding a topic
- Finding supervisors ( i.e agreeing on a topic )
- Realizing the thesis
- Defending the thesis ( colloquium )
- Submitting documentation
- Publishing the thesis

It is the student’s obligation to plan and execute the thesis. This also includes setting up dates with *both* supervisors and discussing the project’s progress. Both supervisors should be *kept in the loop* at all times.

Students should be aware that virtually every project needs funding. There are multiple ways of addressing this fact, for example:

- Raising money ( e.g through side jobs, crowdfunding, etc. )
- Finding sponsors ( e.g companies, research institutions, etc. )
- Applying for cultural or project funding ( incl. HfK internal programs )

## Thesis Topics

Finding a thesis topic is already a vital part of the thesis. Early discussions with potential supervisors are highly advised. Some have compiled lists of *areas of interest*. Make sure to ask them about these.

Other students’ bachelor and master theses are also a good source of inspiration. The Digital Media website hosts a growing archive of successful [bachelor and master theses](https://digitalmedia-bremen.de/projects).

Furthermore, we always encourage interdisciplinary collaborations outside of HfK Bremen.

### Agenda

Students are well advised to also define an agenda complementary to the thesis topic, hidden or open. Exemplary agendas are:

- Learning a specific technology or skill ( e.g programming language or framework, typography, etc. )
- Becoming an *expert* in a specific topic ( e.g understanding Walter Benjamin, working with children, kinetic sculptures, etc. )
- Anticipating a future practice or field of work ( e.g designing exhibitions, iOS developer/designer, new media artist, design research, etc. )
- Planning the thesis to get noticed in specific circles

## Documentation

A thesis is composed of a *written* and a *practical* part. This is not exactly the same as the officially mentioned *documentation*.

For the documentation, a *first part* must be submitted at the end of the period ( *Bearbeitungszeitraum* ) issued by the Prüfungsamt and before the colloquium. A *second part* is usually submitted three weeks after the colloquium.

In the case of a thesis with a decided theoretical bias, the *written part* and the *practical part* may amount to a *theoretical paper*.

### Written Part + Documentation

The written part is often referred to as the *documentation*, but a proper documentation should also contain a record of the practical part.

We acknowledge that there are at least two different types of theses: those with a more practical bias and those with a more theoretical bias. Whereas for the latter, the significance of the written part is obvious, it is important to point out that for the former, the written part plays a substantial role as well.

The thesis can be handed in digital or physical form. Exact formats ( e.g USB stick, DVD, 3.5" floppy drive ) need to be negotiated with supervisors and administration.

Supervisors are usually grateful for a digital version of the written part.

Oftentimes, students invest extra effort to produce a nicely designed documentation in book form. Supervisors usually have a collection of best-practice examples at hand.

### Practical Part + Colloquium

The outcomes of the practical part are presented at the *final colloquium* ( Abschlusskolloquium ) a few weeks after the *first part* of the documentation has been handed in.

The *final colloquium* does not constitute the final action of the thesis. The thesis is only completed once the *second part* of the documentation ( including the written and practical parts ) in the form of a *final documentation* has been handed in to all supervisors and the administration in digital and physical form ( if applicable ).

Depending on the bias of the thesis, the practical outcomes might be the major contribution. These outcomes might be physical or virtual, material or immaterial, interactive or static, objects, installations, spaces, situations, rule-sets, web-based, or visualizations.

In a thesis with a theoretical bias, the practical part can also be an example, a translation, or a transformation of the theoretical paper. The practical part is usually not the major contribution to a thesis with a theoretical bias. The theoretical paper can even be the sole contribution.

#### Colloquium

The *colloquium* is usually conceived as a performance, an exhibition, a lecture, or another kind of artistic presentation. It includes discussions with the audience and should not take longer than one hour.

Oftentimes, the *colloquium* includes a *Werkschau*, which plays only a minor role but can be used to illustrate the student’s development throughout the entire study period.

The *colloquium* is concluded with a *private* discussion between the student and supervisors.

### Practical + Theoretical Bias

#### Practical Bias

In a thesis with a practical bias, the written part can be structured into four segments as follows:

1. Introduction: Concept + motivation + idea-finding process + *prior art* + inspirations + discourses + relevance
2. Implementation: Sketches + ideas for realization + dead ends + methods + process
3. Reflection: Conclusions + discussion + interviews + evaluation + outlooks
4. Documentation of the practical part

As the practical part is often fully realized with the *final colloquium* ( e.g in a fashion show, dance performance, or participatory event ), segment 4 *Documentation of the Practical Part* must remain unfinished until the *final colloquium*.

After the *pre-documentation* has been submitted at the end of the *Bearbeitungszeitraum*, only *editorial changes* should be made ( except for adding segment 4 ).

Students are encouraged to create a well-designed *final documentation* ( e.g in book form ) which includes written and practical parts alike. The *final documentation* may also include additional material like videos, links to websites, etc. The *final documentation* must be handed in **one week** after the *final colloquium*.

#### Theoretical Bias

In a thesis with a theoretical bias, the written part is more than a pre-documentation. In such cases, the theoretical paper must follow academic standards ( with references to actual written articles and theories, with an individual approach developed by the student ).

## External Examiner

As an exception, students can choose external examiners; however, conditions and regulations must be respected. Students should consult the official documents ( e.g *Prüfungsordnung* ) for this.

As a program, we do not actively advise involving external examiners. Past experiences have shown that differing grading opinions can arise. Furthermore, no financial compensation is available.

We often recommend that if students insist on involving an external person for professional, content-related, or strategic reasons, they consider involving them as an external observer or advisor ( *Beisitzer* ).
