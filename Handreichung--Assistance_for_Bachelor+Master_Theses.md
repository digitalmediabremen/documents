# Handreichung / Assistance for Bachelor + Master Theses

this document aims to function as an informal guideline for developing and completing a bachelor or a master thesis. it is a set of suggestions rather than rules. every student is encouraged to digress from these suggestions wherever suitable, but should be equally prepared to justify such decisions later. first and foremost a thesis is supposed to document a student’s ability to independently develop and work on a complex and relevant project.

the statements in this document do not override the existing *prüfungsordnungen*.

## modus operandi

a thesis usually consists of a series of sometimes intermingled steps:

- finding a topic
- finding supervisors ( i.e agreeing on a topic )
- realizing thesis
- defending thesis ( colloquium )
- submitting documentation
- publishing thesis

it is the student’s obligation to plan and execute the thesis. this also includes setting up dates with *both* supervisors and discussing the project’s progress. both supervisors should be *kept in the loop* at all times.

students should be aware of the fact that virtually every project needs funding. there are multiple ways of addressing this fact, for example:

- raising money ( e.g through side jobs, crowdfunding, etc. )
- finding sponsors ( e.g companies, research institutions, etc. )
- applying for cultural or project funding ( incl. hfk internal programs )

## theses topics

finding a thesis topic is already a vital part of the thesis. early discussions with potential supervisors are highly advised. some have compiled lists of *areas of interest*. make sure to ask them about these.

other students’ bachelor and master theses are also a good source of inspiration. the digital media website hosts a growing archive of successful [bachelor and master theses](https://digitalemedien-bremen.de/projekte/).

furthermore we always encourage interdisciplinary collaborations outside of HfK Bremen.

### agenda

students are well advice to also define an agenda complementary to the thesis topic; hidden or open. exemplary agendas are:

- learning a specific technology or skill ( e.g programming language or framework, typography, etc. )
- becoming an *expert* in a specific topic ( e.g understanding walter benjamin, working with children, kinetic sculptures, etc. )
- anticipating a future practice or field of work ( e.g designing exhibitions, iOS developer/designer, new media artist, design research, etc. )
- planning the thesis to get noted in specific circles

## written and practical part

a thesis is composed of a *written* and a *practical* part. the written part is officially referred to as the *documentation* and must be handed in at the end of the *bearbeitungszeitraum* issued by the prüfungsamt. the practical part is presented at the *final colloquium* ( abschlusskolloquium ) a few weeks after the *documentation* has been handed in. in case of a thesis with a decided theoretical-bias the *written part* and the *practical part* will amount to become a *theoretical paper*.

### written part

we acknowledge at least two different types of theses: those with a more practical-bias and those with a more theoretical-bias. whereas for the latter it is quite obvious what kind of significance the written part has, it is important to point out that for the former the written part plays a substantial role as well.

supervisors are usually grateful for a digital version of the written part.

#### practical-bias

in a thesis with a practical-bias the written part can be structured in 4 segments, as follows:

1. introduction: concept + motivation + idea-finding process + *prior art* + inspirations + discourses + relevance
2. implementation: sketches + ideas for realisation + dead ends + methods + process
3. reflection: conclusions + discussion + interviews + evaluation + outlooks
4. documentation of practical part

as the practical part is often only fully realized with the *final colloquium* ( for example in a fashion show, a dance performance, or a participatory event ), it is apparent that segment 4 *documentation of practical part* must remain unfinished until the *final colloquium* thus rendering the documentation unfinished. although the written part is officially referred to as the *documentation* we rather see it as a *pre-documentation*. only in combination with the documentation of the practical part will it accumulate to become the proper *final documentation*.

after the *pre-documentation* has been submitted at the end of the *bearbeitungszeitraum* only *editorial changes* should be made ( with the exception of course of adding segment 4 ).

students are very much encouraged to create a well-designed and well-produced *final documentation* ( for example in book form ) which includes written and practical parts alike. the overall appearance of this *final documentation* may be different from that of the *pre-documentation*. the *final documentation* may also include additional material like videos, links to websites, etcetera. the *final documentation* must be handed in **one week** after the *final colloquium*. 

#### theoretical-bias

in a thesis with a theoretical-bias the written part is more than a pre documentation. in such cases the theoretical paper must be based on the rules for scientific papers ( with references based on actual written articles and theories, with an individual approach developed by the student ).

### practical part

the outcomes of the practical part are presented in the *final colloquium*. officially the *final colloquium* constitutes the final action of the thesis but it is worth noting that the thesis is only properly concluded with the submission of the *final documentation* to both supervisors in digital and physical form ( if applicable ).

depending on the bias of the thesis the outcomes might be the major contribution to the thesis. theses outcomes might be physical or virtual, material or immaterial, interactive or static, objects, installations, spaces, situations, rule-sets, web-based, or visualizations. 

in a thesis with a theoretical-bias the practical part can also be an example, a translation or transformation of the theoretical paper. the practical part is usually not the major contribution to a thesis with a theoretical bias. the theoretical paper can even be the sole contribution to the thesis.

### final colloquium

the *final colloquium* is usually conceived as a performance, an exhibition, a lecture or another kind of artistic presentation. it includes discussions with the audience and should not take longer than one hour.

usually the *final colloquium* includes a *werkschau* which only takes a minor role in the *final colloquium* but is supposed to clearly illustrate the student’s development throughout the entire study period.

the *final colloquium* is concluded with a *private discussion* between student and supervisors. 

as a rule of thumb the *final colloquium* amounts to a presentation of approximately 60 minutes, composed of 4 parts: 

- thesis presentation, 30-45 min
- public discussion, 10 min
- private discussion, 5 min

#### inviting others

finally students are highly encouraged to invite others ( fellow students, faculty, and external people ) to their presentation. the invitation should happen approximately 10 days before the presentation.

#### location of presentation

the space, the room, the location is an important aspect of any final colloquium. the choice of where to present a thesis should not be taken lightly but be well considered ( for example a gallery space, an unused building, a public space etcetera ). usually the final colloquium takes place in a room at HfK ( lecture room, auditorium, Gallerie Flut, etcetera ), under certain circumstance it might be necessary though to present outside of HfK. although this option is considered to be an exception, students are encouraged to consider this extra effort if reasonable. the supervisors must agree to any presentation at an external location.

### exemplary schedule for a bachelor thesis

the duration of a bachelor thesis amounts to 4 months. assuming that the bachelor thesis is worked on in the 6th semester an *exemplary* schedule could look as following:

- 01.02           submit title and topic
- 15.02 – 15.06   development of thesis
- 22.07 – 27.07   final colloquium ( as part of the jahresausstellung )

we encourage students to present their thesis in a single selected week alongside with their fellow students. the supervisors are potentially interested in helping to organize and coordinate such public events.

please note that this *jahresausstellung* does not have a fixed date. however it is a great opportunity to show the work to a greater public as well as to participate in the *frese design preis* award.

## location

although the majority of work on the thesis is supposed to be carried out independently ( especially in a master thesis ), students are highly advised to spend the majority of their time in situ ( at hfk and in bremen ). there is usually always a workspace available for thesis students. if a student plans to work on the thesis in another context or location, this needs to be negotiated, well planned, and argued for. reasons that are conceptually not tightly connected to the thesis are usually not acceptable.

## assessment

the supervisor’s assessments of the thesis, based on the *pre-documentation* or the *theoretical paper*, are intentionally kept short. mainly because the full relevance of a thesis will only be revealed with the presentation of the practical part in the *final colloquium*. the supervisors usually agree to writing a more-detailed assessment if it becomes necessary some time after the completion of the program ( for example when applying for a PhD ).

## dissemination

like with every project it is utterly important to disseminate the thesis after completion ( see also [Anatomy of a Project / Documentation + Publication](http://dm-hb.de/dmdfdadap) ).

### exhibiting theses

students hold all rights to their theses, but if reasonable, feasible, and not contradicting the nature or aim of the thesis (i.e commercial or scientific interests), we expect every thesis to be publicly exhibited. we expected students to at least commit to exhibiting their work during the annual exhibition ( hochschultage ). further efforts and ideas to exhibit the thesis projects is usually met with great support and enthusiasm.

usually thesis projects participate in the *hochschulpreis* award during the annual exhibition.

### packaging thesis documentation

a full documentation of the thesis needs to be send to both supervisors a week after the colloquium. the full documentation package includes the following components:

- website conform version ( see [Directions for Preparing Material to Document Projects on Our Website](http://dm-hb.de/dmdfpmtdpoow) )
- complete digital documentation
    - PDF version of written part
    - high resolution photos and films
    - source code ( if applicable )
    - selected process documentation ( sketches, scribbles, photos, and films )
- final physical documentation ( e.g in book form or as an object )
