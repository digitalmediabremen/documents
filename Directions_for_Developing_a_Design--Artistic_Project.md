# Directions for Developing a Design/Artistic Project

This is a generalized structure of a typical design/artistic project. Such a project is usually composed of 6 stages:

## Anatomy of a Project

This is a generalized structure of a typical design/artistic project. Such a project is usually composed of 6 stages:

1. research + finding ideas
2. concept
3. realization
4. presentation
5. documentation
6. publication + dissemination

Note that although the stages below are usually executed in the order presented, it is worth noting that it is often useful to meander between stages as required. More generally speaking: always doubt strict structures when working in a creative fashion. Break rules where necessary! Also be aware that this article might be biased towards normal or technology-inspired design projects.

### Research + Idea Finding

Usually but not always a project starts with an idea of what the project should achieve or be in the end. Exception to this rule are for example projects that rely on. Although such bottom-up approaches are encouraged you should be aware of the caveats of such approaches.

Note that the term *research* in this context is used to refer to the process of searching through accumulations of, for example, projects. Doing research ( as in *recherche* ) is a good starting point and a good source of inspiration for finding a project idea. Also reading books, going through your favorite blogs, hanging out in cafes and observing people, empathizing with other people’s situations, looking at current and emerging technologies and contemplating their implications, inventing fringe strategies for finding ideas, and most importantly talking to everybody about your thoughts constantly, has proven to be good idea finding strategies. For a more detailed discussion on the topic of researching see [How to Conduct a Recherche?](http://dm-hb.de/dmhtcar).

Once you have an adequately good understanding of what you want to do, *research* is the stage in which you try to put your idea into context. Find projects or research ( as in the systematic advancement of knowledge ) that relates to what you want to do. Try to get an understanding of the current state of affairs? Note that being subjective about a topic is a very legitimate starting point for a design project but be aware that being subjective does not relieve you of the obligation to being able to *defend* your project idea. Essentially you should be able to outline why your project matters and what it contributes to which situation, need, or discourse.

*Research* means broadening your horizon. You should not only compile a list of related design projects but also related scientific papers, theoretical writing[sic!] as well as works from other disciplines. *Research* also means accumulating keywords. After a successful *research* you do not need to know everything about context, background and technologies, but you should at least have a good idea of where and how to find out more about them.

Take note that *research* can be a combination of a multitude of contexts. It can take place in libraries, in archives, in expert interviews and of course on the internet. If you choose to conduct online research, you should at least query the following places:

- google ( self-explanatory )
- wikipedia
- patent databases ( e.g. [Google Patent Search](https://patents.google.com/‎) or [Free Patents Online](http://www.freepatentsonline.com) )
- crowd funding platforms ( e.g. [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) )

But please remember to not just limit yourself to online *research*.

When done with the *research* you should be able to answer the following:

- What is my idea? 
- What has been done already; in design, art and in other disciplines? ( In patent law this is called *prior art*.)
- What does my idea add and why does it matter?

For a discussion on methods for finding and presenting ideas see the article [Directions for Developing Ideas for a Design/Art Project](http://dm-hb.de/dfdifadap)

### Concept

Making a concept involves sharpening your idea. This is achieved by sketching it or at least the crucial parts of it. Sketching can be done with anything from the old-school pen-and-paper method, to building renderings, to sketches done in software, to building quick mock-ups or functional prototypes. 

The crucial point in conceiving a concept is finding the right balance between showing the broader picture and describing essential details. Another important balance needs to be found between faking things ( mock-up ) and actually build things ( functional prototype ). If you are uncertain about a specific aspect in your project, especially technologically, you should use the concept phase for evaluating the feasibility of this aspect.

When done with the *concept* stage you should be able to present and communicate the concept in a way that people actually understand it and more importantly see the beauty of it. You should also be able to verify that the idea is feasible within the given constraints ( usually skills, money and time ), or at least have a good reason why feasibility does not matter to your project.

- What is my idea exactly?
- Is my idea feasible?
- What are the desired out come and it which context will they *live*?
- What steps are necessary to get it done?

### Realization

Realizing a project is about getting down to the nitty gritty. Realizing a project is about negotiating between ideas or expectations and reality. It is important to understand that next to actually working on a design, software or hardware, realizing a project also means communicating with people; sometimes this is the only thing you actually do. Working with technology almost always involves working with people who know how to do very specific things you are not capable of.

More often than not it is required to go back to the *concept* stage and reorganize your thoughts and adjust your idea to the new given. In your project these two stages should be the most permeable ones. When people talk of an iterative design process, they usually refer to the back and forth between *concept* and *realization*.

As a matter of fact, sometimes you are well advised to not even separate the *concept* and *realization* stage and subscribe to a strategy known as *bottom-up* process, by evolving your concept as you go. Although this approach has been successfully applied by, for example, nature, it bears the risk of not getting anywhere and ending up with nothing. The upside however is to potentially create something beyond what you could have imagined beforehand.

When done with the *realization* stage you are not done with your project; a common mistake. 

### Presentation

Properly presenting your project is almost as important as the project itself. Presentations very much depend on the context. A context is composed of two aspects: the external giving settings ( like space, people, room, time of year et cetera ) and the internal settings ( which are entirely defined by your project and yourself ). Every presentation is a performance. Understand and empathize with the people who listen to you. They are your audience. Naturally there are many ways to construct a presentation, from arrogance to warmth, from rational to cryptic and mysterious, from punk to polished and clean.

One strategy that has proven to work well most of the times is the *explain-your-project-in-two-to-three-sentence* strategy. Allocate a bit of time when preparing a presentation to summarize your project in just a few words. Sometimes it proves to be a wise choice to not just talk about idea and concept but equally as much about the realized result; sometimes the work speaks for itself.

### Documentation

The *documentation* is an essential part of every project; especially in more complex and technology-related projects. Oftentimes projects are very fragile physically and conceptually, in time and space. It such cases it is even more important to preserve your project as a documentation ( at least through photo and video ).

Making a good documentation is a skill of it’s own. Apart from the idea of preservation, it is no secret that a documentation can and should be used to amplify the aspects of your project that worked well. A *documentation* should be utilized to make your project shine in its best light. The *documentation* can also be used to illustrate situations that emerged but were not anticipate in the concept.

### Publication + Dissemination

Furthermore, in a rather scientific mindset, the documentation is what other people can use as a reference when working on their own projects, just like you might did when you started yours. Publishing your project is part of one big collaborative effort. It could be argued that your projects contribute to building a *design knowledge*. You are also encouraged to write ( e.g in scientific paper format ) about your project.

After having finished the documentation you are highly encouraged to submit your project to magazines, blogs, contests, exhibitions, festivals et cetera. It is of grave importance to get your projects published, nominated, exhibited et cetera. Additionally, in a truly recursive manner, showing your work in public generates more feedback, discussions and also *footage* to make your documentation even more interesting.

If you are uncertain about where to submit your work contact your supervisors. We keep lists of current blogs, calls, awards, conferences, and festivals ( for example [Aktuelle Ausschreibungen](http://dm-hb.de/1u) or [Aktuelle Konferenzen](http://dm-hb.de/1v) or [Blogs for Interaction Designers and New Media Artists](http://dm-hb.de/1w) ).

## When is a Project done?

This question can be addressed from different directions. for example:

- a project is done when it is documented and published
- a project is done when the designer/artist says it is done
- a project is done when the supervisor/customer/… says it is done
- a project is never done

regardless of which perspective is used as a qualifier, it is well worth noting that each stage might be *enough* for a project to be complete.
