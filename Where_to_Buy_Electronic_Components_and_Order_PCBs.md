## PCB production and assembly

- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) #CHINA @comment(dpp, "#1. very reliable, very helpful, good service. supports makers and youtubers i.e the community. also extremely cheap. only drawback is the customs issues. sometimes german customs delays delivery by demanding *things*. has black PCBs ;)")
- [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) #CHINA 
- [Aisler](https://aisler.net) #EU @comment(dpp, "i REALLY want to support this. it is more or less in the neighborhood, has a good attitude and a nice interface ( i.e KiCad plugin ), however, it is soooo much more expensive and does not support 6-layer stack-up â€¦ anymore.")
