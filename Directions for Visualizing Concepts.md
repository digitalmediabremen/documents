# Directions for Visualizing Concepts

*visualizing concepts* is a crucial part of most art/design project. while it is widely understood that such visualizations are of grave relevance in the beginning of a work or project, it is worth noting that visualizations can and should play an important role over the course of the entire project depending on the *volatility* of the work and the context.

although this document refers to the notion of *visualizing* ( i.e regarding the visual sense ) it wants imply other forms of translations into other senses as well, for example:

- sonifications
- written words ( including narrative and poetic forms )
- rapid prototyping
- …

a *concept* in this context refers not only to concepts for works and projects but also extends to related topics such as:

- ideas
- plans
- notions
- thoughts
- …

### Why Visualize Concepts and Why it Matters?

it has become a default to use concept visualizations in the beginning of a project to be able to communicate first ideas and make them discussible. regardless of whether this happens in the context of a client-contract situation or as part of an application for a grant.

in this context visualizations are tools for visual retorics to persuade, advertise and lure. it is important to realize and accept this. even the most neutral visualizations communications on multiple levels not just on the topic it visualizes and thereby says a lot about the way one works and how one creates a *public image*. visualization can and should be used strategically.

on the other hand visualization serve as important tools to communicate complex topics ( on a factual, emotional, rational and irrational level ). it is a quite epiphanic moment to see a group of recipents to react differently to a spoke description and a visualized explanation of an idea.

a random but nice example is the double pendulum. described in words "a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end". everybody knows what a pendulum does and can image what two connect pendula do. or can they? just observing the animation of a double pendulum evokes so many associations of a laid-back person.

### A few Words on Visualizaton Style

- neutral vs eccentric	 / exalted
- some develop their own visualizaton style

## Methods + Strategies for Visualizing Concepts

- @note(from napkin to software sketch)

- sketches
- photomontage
- collages
- moodboards
- renderings
- references e.g:
    - design/art works
    - inventions
    - research papers
    - patents
- mock-ups ( material + photo + video )
- video prototypes
- software sketches
