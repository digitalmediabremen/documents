# Directions for Visualizing Concepts

visualizing concepts is a crucial part of every art/design project. while it is widely understood that visualizations are of grave relevance in the beginning of a work or project, it is worth noting that visualizations can and should play an important role over the course of the entire project depending on the *volatility* of the work and the context.

although this document refers to the notion of *visualizing* ( i.e regarding the visual sense ) it implies other forms of translations as well, for example:

- sonifications
- written words
- rapid prototyping
- …

a *concept* in this context refers not only to actual concepts for works and projects but also to:

- ideas
- plans
- notions
- thoughts 
- …

- @note(some develop their own visualizaton style)
- @maybe(look at architecture and fashion)

## Methods + Strategies for Visualizing Concepts

- @note(from napkin to software sketch)

- sketches
- photomontage
- collages
- moodboards
- renderings
- references e.g:
    - design/art works
    - inventions
    - research papers
    - patents
- mock-ups ( material + photo + video )
- video prototypes
- software sketches
