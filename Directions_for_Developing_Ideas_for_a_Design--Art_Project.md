## Methods for Finding Ideas

generating good ideas is the howly grail in art + design. many myths are shrouding the process of how people come to have good ideas ( see e.g the concept/myth of the *genius* ). there are millions of methods, books, seminars, and writings about the topic. still there is no unifed truth regarding the applicability and quality of methods; some methods are better than others and some methods work for some people better than others for other people. while there is a significant amount of people arguing that the whole idea of applying methods to the finding of ideas is flawed. thus it is of grave importance that one experiments with and identifies the methods that work best for oneself. experimenting with such methods and reflecting their effect on oneself is first and foremost a way of understand oneself better ( similar to reading a horoscope which is also much more about understanding oneself than predicting the future ).

from my own experience i can say that there is no single method which i found superior. still i cultivated an interest in hearing, learning and subjectively evaluating such methods; but always with a critical mindset, a great deal of suspicion and most importantly always on my *own terms*.

### problem solving

- the mother of all idea finding methods
- often overly stretchted ( when everything is considered a problem or when situations are labeled problems that a really not `#firstworldproblems` )
- *identify a problem and solve it*
- almost any everyday situation or interaction can serve as a *problem* ( e.g "putting on socks in the morning" produces a *strumpfanziehhilfe* )

### observing situations + people

look at everyday situations. important and insignificant. small and big. describe and analyze such situations. see what *you* would want to change about these situations but also contemplate what others might want, need, or desire.

similarly shift the focus away from situation and assume a *human-centered* perspective by observing people. how do they do things? what do they care about? become acquainted with your *audience* ( recipient, customer, client, user, … ). it might be worth considering to invest some extra effort, planning, and preparing to be able to better observe people. interviews in all shapes and forms are traditionally a powerful tool to learn and understand. however being a design it is also worth considering to deliberately design for this endeavor. find or design other or new ways to learn about people ( see e.g *cultural probes* ).

by the way, the ability to project oneself into the mind of another person is an important skill when observing people and situations. this ability is often refered to as empathy. empathy is a central ability for designers; not only when finding ideas. to be able to empathize with the people one is designing for allows for a permanent evaluation of the design and the design process.

### by reference / derivative idea

schaut arbeiten von anderen an. auch: bands spielen zuerst lieder nach. es geht darum ähnlichkeiten zu finden und diese weiter zu entwickeln. ausserdem ist es gut eine bereits bearbeitete nicht geistlos zu imitieren.

### improving exiting things

look at all things that exist, whether human-made ( artifact ) or produced by nature and strive to improve them. obviously the notion of *improving* is a fuzzy concept but even more interesting to define, vary, and argue for.

### mesh-up + symbiosis

combine two or more ideas, concepts, technologies, material, etcetera that were hitherto not. 

### wandering thoughts + low-attention + misunderstanding

- @todo(peter s example of looking at amounts of photographs of other people’s projects and misinterpreting them)
- @todo(dennis s example of reading complicated literature)

### serendipity

@todo ( creating *productive situations* and then relying on random discoveries )

### arbitrary constraints

take an exisiting concept or idea and ( almost ) arbitrarily constraint certain parameters of that concept or idea. in traditional graphic design the notion of *only using one font, one fontsize, and two colors* to create a complex modular design is quite a common starting point.

### rethink the assignment

if there is an assignment. look at it analyze it, take it apart and put it back together in different ways.

### the normal

the first idea. think of the normal. speak it out, sketch it out. then think beyond that.

### rubberduck

talk to people, things or rubberducks. it is not so much about the reactions but about formulating thoughts while speaking.

### inversion

nimm eine annahme und invertiere sie. zB "navigationssystem sind dafür da jemanden möglichst schnell von punkt A zu punkt B zu bringen. inversion: was wäre wenn navigationssysteme dafür da wären jemanden möglichst langsam ( möglichst umwegig ) von A nach B zu bringen."

### thinking with hands

do, make, build, scribble, sketch.

### physical exercise

showering, walking, jogging, cycling.

### keep sketch book by your bed

habe immer ein skizzen buch ( digital / papier ) auf dem nachtisch. oft kommen 

### sprints

arbeite an einer idee, eine kurze bestimmte zeit. diskutiert sie dann.

### civilised conversation

als vorgehen auch als *brainstorming* bekannt. redet mit leuten. es kommt auf die gute atmosphäre an. es gibt keine schlechten ideen, nur solche die weiterverfolgt werden und andere die nicht weiterverfolgt werden. an materialien ist natürlich alles erlaubt. häufig wird neben dem reden geskribbelt.

### randomness

write an application that randomly combines multiple sets of words. you pick the good permutations from the bad ones.

### explore analogies

aus vergleichen neue ideen. ein mögliches sprachmuster hierzu ist *wie … nur für … .* ( beispiel: *wie **facebook** nur für **tiere**.* )

### matrix

ideenfindung in dem kreuzen von eigenschaften. bsp aus dem vortrag ›graham harman: Art and Paradox‹:

| A                  | +       | B                  |                   |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| believe in god     | because | he exists          | theist            |
| not believe in god | because | he does not exists | atheist           |
| not believe in god | because | he exists          | lucifer, cpt ahab |
| believe in god     | because | he does not exists | ?                 |

### variations

take an exisiting idea, identify a *parameter*, and deliberately create variations of it. then discard the variations that are not *interesting*.

## Strategies for Presenting + Visualizing Ideas

it is also of grave importance to choose and develop strategies to transport ideas. there is a wide range of proven strategies established in the field of design/art. below is a list of some of the most common ones:

- sketches
- photomontage
- collages
- moodboards
- renderings
- references e.g:
    - design/art works
    - inventions
    - research papers
    - patents
- mock-ups ( material + photo + video )
- video prototypes
- software sketches
