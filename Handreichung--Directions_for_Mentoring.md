# Handreichung / Directions_for_Mentoring

the goal for every mentor should be to get a good idea of what each mentee is doing in the current semester

- contact mentees in the beginning of the semester
- check keywords in *the table* (@todo add link)
- try to get a feedback from ever single mentee ( even if mentees need to be contacted directly )
- if mentees do not respond ( after e.g 2â€“3 times ) contact Dez.1 an inquire about the status
