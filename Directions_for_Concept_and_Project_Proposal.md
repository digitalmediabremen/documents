# Directions for Concept and Project Proposals

this is a very rough guide for producing a *project proposal* ( or concept ). in this context the proposal refers to a project that has not been realized but is already in the state of research and experimentation. what follows is a listing of helpful questions and *ingredients*. Not all *ingredients* are necessary for all projects but may act as a guideline, starting point or default:

a *project proposal* ( e.g in the form of a presentation, PDF document or a video ) is an essential tool to communicate and discuss a project’s concept and its potential implementation. in a professional context it is a medium that is crucial for example for applying for project funding in commercial or in the public cultural sector as well as applications for grants, calls for stipends, pitches but also for more novel formats like crowdfunding projects.

## Description of the Concept/Idea

> *Concepts are not in your head: they are things, peoples, zones, regions, thresholds, gradients, temperatures, speeds, etc.* { Gilles Deleuze, Desert islands and Other Texts 1953-1974, p 312 } 

- what was the *impulse* for the project?
- what is your motivation?
- how does this project relate to previous projects or interests? ( maybe it is connected to research that reaches back to some of your previous projects or to projects of others )
- name references from Design, Art, Media Theory, Science, Philosophy etc.
- what form/media does the project have/use? e.g
    - installation
    - digital object
    - physical object
    - object series
    - machine
    - book
    - website
    - series of experiments
    - performance
    - body extension / wearable / cyborg organ
    - *Aktion*
- what form/format are you using for *publishing*? e.g
    - exhibition
    - performance
    - commercial product
    - blog-o-sphere

## Sketch and Visualize

- sketch and visualize in your preferred medium or software e.g 
    - blender
    - processing.org
    - photoshop
    - illustrator
    - pen&paper
    - materials
- simulations and/or renderings / screenshots
- photos of physical models ( drawing into photos can help as well )

## Technical Implementation

- how is it realized?
- what technologies/materials are you using?
- is there something unique about the used tech?
- how are you using technology?
- is it a hack or maybe a re-appropriation?

## Current State of the Project

- documentation of experiments and prototypes
- what did you try already?
- what did you learn through the experiments?
- Did the result of the experiment change the direction of the project?

## Feasibility Check!

- is the project really feasible? in regards to …
    - available time
    - financial resources
    - skills
    - collaborators
- be true to yourself!

## How do you Present/Perform the Proposal?

- default: well prepared slide-based presentation presented on a projector
- but also take a minute to consider alternative forms of presentations? e.g:
    - performance
    - recorded video
    - text reading

## Make it Look Nice and Convincing!

- an appealing presentation helps to communicate your point
- presentations also always set a mood or atmosphere
- design it consistently
- how does the theme/project topic translate into your design?
- use another medium to communicate your point!
- KIS ( keep it simple )

## Known Problems ;)

- sometimes a project is not that clear yet. 
- sometimes we don’t know where a project is leading to. do not make it a problem but a *feature*. but also make sure to communicate your interests and reflect upon why you want to embark on such exploration. trust the process!
- sometimes it is difficult to prematurely *visualize* a project. try it anyway. it will help other but also youself to unterstand what you are onto. use all sorts of different tools or media e.g:
    - physical models
    - sketches
    - collages
    - renderings

# Bonus

additional topics or questions to consider while planning or sketching a project ( some of these *ingredients* become especially important when a project exceeds a certain level of complexity ):

## How does the Audience/Visitor/Recipient/User Experience your Installations/Software/Artifacts/Performance/Product?

- describe the audience/visitor/recipient/user’s perception/experience ( with words or in other forms )
- how is the setup?
- what is the context?
- in what situation will perception or experience happen? e.g:
    - in a museum
    - at home
    - in space
- try to also visualze such experiences ( e.g "hello render ghosts ;)" )

## Schedule/Timetable

carefully plan the different steps of the project implementation, keeping in mind that plans a subject to change. what follows are a series of more or less chronological steps for an installation work:

- research
- experimenting
- prototyping
- production
- testing
- transport
- installation
- exhibition or presentation
- documentation
- dissemination

## Budget

- make a precise calculation of the planned project
    - consider using a spreadsheet program 
    - make the calculation *fine grained*
    - include contingencies
    - research or query actual prices for actual components and materials
    - make sure to watch delivery and lead times ( "oftentimes you can save money by ordering early" )
- assess whether the project fits in your budget? if you foresee budget problems, consider e.g the following:
    - ask your grandma for some cash! ;) ( @RB "really?!? this is how you did it?" )
    - ask your professor to buy some components for general use afterwards
    - apply for funding ( e.g HfK student project funding, HEC Sponsorship, HfK Freundeskreis )
