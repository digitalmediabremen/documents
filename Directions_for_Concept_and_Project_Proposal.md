# Directions for Concept and Project Proposals

A very rough guide for producing a project proposal/concept (a project that has not been realized but is in the state of research and experimentation already). a listing of helpful questions and ingredients.
not all ingredients are necessary for all projects. 

## General

A project proposal/concept (e.g. in the form of a presentation, pdf document or a video) is an essential tool to communicate and discuss a project’s concept and its potential implementation. In a professional context it is a medium that is crucial for applying for project funding in commercial or in the public cultural sector. (e.g. calls for stipends or grants, pitches also for crowdfunding a project.)

## Description of the Concept/Idea

"Concepts are not in your head: they are things, peoples, zones, regions, thresholds, gradients, temperatures, speeds, etc.”
{ Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974, p 312 } 

- What is the “impulse” for the project?
- What is your motivation?
- How does this project relate to previous projects or interests? (maybe it is connected to research that reached back to previous projects )
- Name references from Design, Art, Media Theory, Science, Philosophy etc.
- What form does the project have: installation, digital object, physical object, machine, website, series of experiments, performance, “Aktion”
- What form/format are you using for dissemination? 

## Sketch and Visualize

- Sketches and visualize ( in your preferred medium/software )
- e.g. blender, processing, illustrator, 3D modeler, paper/pencil
- Simulations and/or renderings / screenshots
- Photos of physical models ( drawing into photos can help as well )
- Please head over to this guide for further inspiration: [Directions_for_Visualizing_Concepts](https://github.com/digitalmediabremen/documents/blob/master/Directions_for_Visualizing_Concepts.md)

## Technical implementation

- How is it realized?
- What technologies/materials are you using?
- Is there something unique about the used tech?
- How are you using technology?
- Is it a hack or maybe a re-appropriation?

## Current state of the project

- Documentation of experiments and prototypes
- What did you try already?
- What did you learn through the experiments?
- Did the result of the experiment change the direction of the project?

## Feasibility check!

- Is the project really feasible?
- Be true to yourself!

## How do you perform/present the proposal?

- classically with a projector!
- what could be alternative forms of presentations?
- e.g. a performance, a recorded Videos or maybe reading a text?

## Make it look nice!

- It helps to communicate your point
- Design it consistently
- How does the theme/project topic translate into your design.
- Use another medium to communicate your point!
- (keep it simple)

## known problems ;)

- Sometimes a project is not that clear yet. 
- Sometimes we don’t know where a project is leading to. this is not a problem is a *feature* 
- Sometimes it is difficult to visualize a project yet.
- Some help might be found here: [Theory and Design-driven Artistic Practice with, about and through (new) Technologies and Media](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwNdwLStjFsURw0eKTtNJv-CyWoTwwJ08jGdl2DszSw/edit)

# Bonus

Additional things/questions to consider while planning/sketching a project. (some of these *ingredients* become important if the dimension/complexity of a
the project passed a certain scale) 


## How does the audience/visitor/user experience your installations/software/artifacts/performance etc?

- Describe the audience/visitor/user perception/experience (with words)
- How is the setup?
- Images + renderings (incl a point of view perspective)

## Schedule/Timetable

- Plan the different steps of the project implementation
- Research, Experimenting, Prototyping, Production, Testing, Installation, exhibiting and/or presenting

## Budget

- Make a precise calculation of the planned project incl. contingency.
- Does the project fit in your budget?
- Ask your grandma for some cash?
- Ask your professor to buy some stuff for general purposes.
- Apply for the HEC stipend!
