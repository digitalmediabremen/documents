# The Program Manifesto

- none of the following points below are rules, none of them need to be followed or even respected
- *we* refers to you, me, them, and us
- we are a community, we are the program
- we value empathy, as a design method and as a way to interact
- we try to rationalize what we and others do in our works but also contemplate the limits of the practice
- we balance the ratio between thinking, talking, and making carefully
- we discuss works and share thoughts and opinions
- we promise to try to give constructive feedback and critique
- we try to see, value, and respect other students, lecturers, and professors expertise and experience
- we experiment and acknowledge that experiments might fail; we are thereby relieved from having to succeed
- we will be *there*
- the program does not want to *make* you anything but aims to facilitate that you *become*
- the program exist to help you progress, process, develop, and evolve
