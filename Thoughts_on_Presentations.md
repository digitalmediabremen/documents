# DM documents / Thoughts on *Presentations*

@draft

in art+design context presentations are ( or have become ) a pillar of the practice. whether studios or persons, portfolios, individual works or ideas; everythings demands to be presented â€¦ in an *entertaining* way that is. but wait! is that really necessary? are the ways in which we *present* not very conservative and rigid? is every presentation ( willingly or unwillingly ) not a piece of designed communication or a performance?

see [Presenting-Works(wiki)](https://github.com/digitalmediabremen/presenting-works/wiki) more unsorted thoughts on presentations e.g [Presentation Formats](https://github.com/digitalmediabremen/presenting-works/wiki/Presentation-Formats)

@todo(process and merge with wiki)

- check the technical details in advance. e.g:
    - what connectors are available?
    - how is the lighting situation?
    - how are people arranged in the room?
- pre-record *unstable* sections of presentation ( e.g as movies or sound recordings or photos). e.g:
    - technical demonstration
    - functional prototypes ( e.g arduino sketches )
    - demonstrators
- in an *intermediate presentation* try to give a sense of *what your work will be like in the end*
- while slide-based ( i.e powerpoint/keynote ) presentations are a good default and leave a lot of room for creativity, they are by far not the only way to present works. designing a presentation is a *design* task in itself!
