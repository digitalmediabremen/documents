# DM documents / thoughts on *presentations*

@draft

- check the technical details in advance. e.g:
    - what connectors are available?
    - how is the lighting situation?
    - how are people arranged in the room?
- pre-record *unstable* sections of presentation ( e.g as movies or sound recordings or photos). e.g:
    - technical demonstration
    - functional prototypes ( e.g arduino sketches )
    - demonstrators
- in an *intermediate presentation* try to give a sense of *what your work will be like in the end*
- while slide-based ( i.e powerpoint/keynote ) presentations are a good default and leave a lot of room for creativity, they are by far not the only way to present works. designing a presentation is a *design* task in itself!
